    # Normally I would pin to a particular Ubuntu version to avoid breakage when
    # `ubuntu-latest` is updated to a newer release, but that only works for
    # projects that are developed sufficiently heavily. I don't anticipate doing
    # much more development in this repository so this workflow would probably
    # become outdated, so just point at ubuntu-latest. This is a pretty simple
    # project so I don't anticipate breakage regardless.
